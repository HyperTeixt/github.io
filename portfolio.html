          <p>A hobby project of mine that stemmed from being unable to find a good way to track my progress at the gym.
            There were a few apps that could do what I wanted, but they either took too many steps to enter data or had
            poorly implemented ads. I was able to get a refresher in iOS development and now have the app I want to use
            at the gym, a win-win situation.</p>

                A simple pricing calculator built with the lightning component framework and SLDS. Rather than having sales representatives referencing outdated pricing matrices or modifying opportunity line items to see pricing, use a simple calculator throughout Salesforce.

                  Designing the implementation of Marketo at a company with four different divisions was an enjoyable challenge. If these divisions were siloed then I could have just used workspaces and partitions and called it a day. However, this was not the case since program sharing was essential for the lead generation team. Enter Marketo tokens(variables).
                </p>
                <p>
                    By creating email and landing page templates that used tokens for style values, I was able to segment divisions by folders with local tokens and have assets inside inherit the values. This structure allowed the divisions to share programs and have the branding change dynamically.

                    At Starbucks, partners(employees) all have coffee passports which are small booklets that detail each coffee blend. While they are handy cheat sheets, the primary use of these passports is to write down tasting notes while doing coffee tastings. I frequently noticed regular customers asking to join tastings and always saying things like "I can't remember if I like that one." 
                    Since I wouldn't expect customers to carry the full passport around, I had the idea to make all the coffee blends as cards that could fit into a wallet or pocket. Stores would put these out during a tasting for customers to write on and whichever partner liked the coffee the most would put their name on the back so the customer could come back at any time and discuss. I ran a local store test and had a great response from the partners, sales for the specific blend increased, and most importantly was able to create a better relationship with the customers that participated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It looks like Starbucks had the same idea a year later but as a <a href="http://passport.starbucks.com/starbucks-coffees/veranda-blend">mobile website</a>.
